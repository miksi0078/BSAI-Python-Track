# Python Data Science & AI Foundation

This repository tracks my progression and technical execution in Python, transitioning from a strong C++ foundation into Data Science and Machine Learning. 

## Objectives
* Mastering Python syntax and dynamic data structures.
* Implementing data cleaning and manipulation pipelines using Pandas and NumPy.
* Storing assignments and practical code from IBM and Stanford AI specializations.

## Technologies Used
* Python 3
* Google Colab (Jupyter Notebooks)
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy (Upcoming: Scikit-Learn)
